            <h1>JANUARY BRINGS US FIREFOX 85</h1>
            <p>
              To wrap up January, we are proud to bring you the release of
              Firefox 85. In this version we are bringing you support for the
              :focus-visible pseudo-class in CSS and associated devtools, and
              the complete removal of Flash support from Firefox.

            The release of Apple Silicon-based Macs at the end of last year
            generated a flurry of news coverage and some surprises at the
            machine’s performance. This post details some background information
            on the experience of porting Firefox to run natively on these CPUs.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’ll start with some background on the Mac transition and give an
            overview of Firefox internals that needed to know about the new
            architecture, before moving on to the concept of Universal Binaries.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’ll then explain how DRM/EME works on the new platform, talk about
            our experience with macOS Big Sur, and discuss various updater
            problems we had to deal with. We’ll conclude with the release and an
            overview of various other improvements that are in the pipeline.

              This button would add a box to the row of key content boxes below
              the intro text. This should put the box there regardless of where
              the user is currently writing.

            <h1>2 Another site</h1>
            <p>
              I'd suggest having a popup that asks where in the row to insert
              the box (at the beginning or end), what title to give the box,
              what text to put in the box, and where the box should link to. The
              entire box should serve as a link to the destination page.

              You can also include a type attribute containing the MIME type of
              the resource, so a browser can quickly see what resources are on
              offer, and ignore ones that it doesn’t support
